# Lab 02b: Manage Governance via Azure Policy

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lab focuses on using **Azure Policy** to enforce governance rules. We define policies, assign them, and check compliance.

## ðŸš€ What I Did:
âœ… Created an **Azure Policy Definition** using PowerShell & Azure CLI  
âœ… Assigned policies to enforce **tag compliance** on resources
