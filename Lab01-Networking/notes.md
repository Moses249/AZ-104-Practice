## 🌐 What is a Virtual Network (VNet)?
A Virtual Network (VNet) allows Azure resources to securely communicate with each other.

## 🏗️ Steps in This Lab:
1. **Create a VNet**
2. **Define Address Spaces**
3. **Add Subnets**
4. **Configure an NSG**
5. **Test connectivity**

## 🔥 Key Learnings:
- VNets in Azure are **isolated networks** for cloud resources.
- **Subnets** help segment resources within a VNet.
- **Network Security Groups (NSG)** allow/restrict network access.
